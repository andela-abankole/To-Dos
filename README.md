## How To Use And Interface
The app is simpler than it looks, and can be use to take down thinks you want to do.

  1- Start by entering what you want to into the Input field that says- "Add a new task, just start typing..."

  2- After that set your priority, you can either use "HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, NONE", whichever that suits your task.

  3- Click on the ADD TASK Button, to add your task.

  4- Repeat line 1 to 3 to add more tasks.

  5- Under your to-do is a Date and Time.

  6- The DELETE Button deletes any tasks you mark as done. 

  7- You can use the CLEAR ALL Button to clear all your tasks but checked and unchecked.

  8- The small indicator that appears as colors means "GREEN(HIGH), ORANGE(MEDIUM), RED(LOW), BLACK(NONE)", the indicator works with the priority.

  9- NOTE:: If nothing is selected the color is display as GREY!
  
  11- Cheers!
